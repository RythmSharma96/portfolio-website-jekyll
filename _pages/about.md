Hi There 🙋! I'm an Software Developer and engineering enthusiast with 7+ years of experience building systems that talk, scale and don't fall apart (I try my best 😅).

I started out my career as a Full Stack Developer at [NCR](https://www.ncr.com/) and after a few stints landed Senior roles at [Paytm](https://paytm.com/) and [FreJun](https://frejun.com/). Here, I was in charge of leading my own teams and building `highly scalable services` from scratch, working on problems like real time communication,distributed processing and low latency APIs.

I left my role as a Backend Lead at Frejun, to start [Rhythmiq](https://www.rhythmiqcx.com/) where
I work as the Technical Founder. We are building an all encompassing AI first customer support solution for businesses that replaces traditional support via AI Agents. This helped me leverage my skills of traditional
web and telephony development as well as work hands on with AI systems on `LLM orchestration, RAG pipelines, streaming STT/TTS, SIP-based telephony` etc. If you're interested, I'd love to give you a demo!

When I’m not building software, I’m usually thinking about bikes, cars, training, or why some designs (engineering or otherwise) age better than others.

I'm always on the lookout for new things to learn and problems to solve.
If any of this sounds relevant, feel free to reach out! I'm always happy to talk shop or give a demo. You can find my socials below or `reach out to me here:` [📧](mailto:rythmrobin@gmail.com).
